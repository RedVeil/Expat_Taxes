      <p>In Germany, this title is for self-employed professionals with special qualifications who sell their services.
        Self-employed doctors, lawyers, accountants, engineers, or people who pursue a scientific, artistic, literary, 
        teaching or educational activity are are usually Freiberufler. 
        Common jobs like food delivery driver or tour guide do not qualify as Freiberufler, even though some of them would could in english as freelancers.
        Therfore i will stick to the german word in this explanation, as it is an important distinction for the tax office,
      </p>
      <p>If all of this sounds a bit vague, it's because it is. As jobs are getting more loosely defined its harder 
        to define who really is or isn't a Freiberufler. Try to work out the creative, artistic or/and intellectual 
        aspect of your work, if you want to register as a Freiberufler.</p>
      <p>If your description does not meet the criteria, the tax office will 
        ask you to explain your job and make a decision if you are in fact a Freiberufler or not.</p>
      <p>There are a few benefits to being a Freiberufler:</p>
      <li>You do not need to register in the Handelsregister, the German Trade Register1.</li>
      <li>You do not need a Gewerbeschein (trade licence)</li>
      <li>You do not need to pay the Gewerbesteuer (trade tax)</li>
      <li>You do not need to use double entry bookkeeping.</li>
      <p>If you are self-employed but you are not a Freiberufer, then you are a Gewerbetreibende (tradesperson).
        Websites and businesses that sell physical products are definitely in this category.
        Independent delivery and call centre employees must also apply as a Gewerbe, since they don't qualify as Freiberufler.
      </p>
      <p>Compared to Freiberufler, businesses have a few special obligations:</p>
      <li>They must register in the Handelsregister, the German Trade Register.</li>
      <li>They must apply for a Gewerbeschein (trade licence) and pay the Gewerbesteuer (trade tax).</li>
      <li>They must use double entry bookkeeping.</li>
